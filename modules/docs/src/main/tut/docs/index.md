## How to Learn

This documentation teaches you how to use **Tuco** through a series of worked examples. It is *not a big API* and some users will grok it by skimming the doc and experimenting. But this style of programming is not familiar to everyone and it's worthwhile to build up slowly for those who haven't done this before.

If you have questions, comments, or suggestions **please open an issue** on GitHub so we can improve the doc/API/whatever. This is a very young project and we have the freedom to make aggressive improvements as ideas come in.

The documentation follows the following progression:

- **Hello World** builds a minimal interactive server, just to get us started.
- **Guessing Game** builds a "guess the number" game, which demonstrates richer behavior, with looping and branching.
- **Command Shell To-Do List** introduces the **Command Shell** API which provides a way to define an application as a set of commands that manipulate session state.

The documentation **is not done**. Not even close. If you become confused and have to look at the source, sorry, but that's the deal right now. Much more is on the way.
